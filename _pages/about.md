Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Student at the [University School for Advanced Studies IUSS](https://www.iusspavia.it/en) in Pavia (Italy). My main research interests lie in epistemology and formal epistemology. My current PhD project consists in challenging the pluralism of conceptions of “epistemic risk” by means of belief revision theory.

This website serves as my **personal page**, hosting my CV, research, and talks. I also maintain a **personal notebook** [here](https://francescodibetta.github.io/notebook/), which serves as a living document for my literature notes, teaching materials, and drafts. Please feel free to explore and use these resources -- and if you spot any errors, I would be grateful for a heads-up at [francesco.dibetta@iusspavia.it](mailto:francesco.dibetta@iusspavia.it)!
