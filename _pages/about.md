Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Student in Philosophy at the [University School for Advanced Studies IUSS](https://www.iusspavia.it/en) in Pavia (Italy), and member of the [DeEP Project](https://lucazanetti91-nhigo.wpcomstaging.com/), funded by the Italian Science Fund (FIS) and led by Dr. Luca Zanetti. My main research interests are epistemology and formal epistemology. My PhD project challenges the pluralism of “epistemic risk” conceptions from the perspective of belief revision theory.

Before starting my doctoral studies, I earned my MA from the University of Milan and my BA from the University of Pavia. I am also an alumnus of the [Ghislieri College](https://www.ghislieri.it/) and hold a Diploma from IUSS Pavia.

This website serves as my **personal page**, hosting my CV, research, and talks. I also maintain a personal notebook (see [this link](https://francescodibetta.github.io/notebook/) or the navigation bar), which serves as a living document for my literature notes, teaching materials, and drafts. Please feel free to explore and use these resources -- and if you spot any errors, I would be grateful for a heads-up at [francesco.dibetta@iusspavia.it](mailto:francesco.dibetta@iusspavia.it)!

Outside of academia, I try to keep creative by playing the guitar and taking photos -- mostly street and landscape shots. I am also an enthusiastic (if amateur) runner. Proof of my amateur athletic career can be found on my Strava profile below.
